# Household_Power_Consumption_Dataset (Exploratory_Analysis)
# Patterns in Observations Over Time
The data is a multivariate time series and the best way to understand a time series is to create line plots. We can start oﬀ by creating a 
separate line plot for each of the eight variables

A single image is created with eight subplots, one for each variable. 
# Inferences Drawn
1) This gives us a really high level of the four years of one minute observations. 
2) In case of Sub metering 3 (environmental control) energy usage may not directly map to hot or cold years. Perhaps new systems were 
   installed.
3) The contribution of sub metering 4 seems to decrease with time, or show a downward trend, perhaps matching up with the solid increase 
   is seen towards the end of the series for Sub metering 3. 
   These observations do reinforce the need to honor the temporal ordering of subsequences of this data when ﬁtting and evaluating any 
   model. 
4) The wave of a seasonal eﬀect can be seen in the Global active power and some other variates. There is some spiky usage that 
   may match up with a speciﬁc period, such as weekends.
